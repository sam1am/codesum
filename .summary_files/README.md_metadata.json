{"hash": "6cf0951c1622c5e2d59be3a04ac5e5a8", "summary": "### Code Summarizer for LLM Interaction\n\nThis project leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate concise, informative summaries of code for enhancing the understanding and usability for Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers interactive file selection through a curses-based interface, and includes features like summary caching, `.gitignore` compliance, and README.md generation.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n- **Interactive File Selection:** Uses the curses library to allow users to interactively select files for summarization.\n- **Summary Caching:** Implements intelligent caching mechanisms to avoid redundant API calls and improve efficiency.\n- **`.gitignore` Compliance:** Ensures that files listed in `.gitignore` are respected during operations.\n- **Summary Generation:** Produces both detailed and compressed summaries of the selected code files.\n- **Automated README Generation:** Uses GPT-4 to create AI-generated README files for the project.\n- **Command-line Arguments:** Supports various command-line arguments for flexibility and convenience.\n\n#### Installation\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n   ```\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**\n   ```\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n3. **Set Up Python Environment:**\n   ```sh\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n4. **Create a `.env` File:**\n   ```sh\n   echo \"OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\" > .env\n   ```\n5. **Optional Automated Setup:**\n   ```sh\n   ./codesum.sh\n   ```\n\n#### Usage\n\n- **Python Script Execution:**\n  ```sh\n  python app.py [--infer]\n  ```\n  - `--infer`: Flag to enable OpenAI API calls for generating summaries and README.\n\n- **Bash Script Execution:**\n  ```sh\n  chmod +x codesum.sh\n  ./codesum.sh [arguments]\n  ```\n\n#### Useful Information\n\n- The project uses the following dependencies:\n  - `openai`: For interacting with the OpenAI API.\n  - `itsprompt`: For handling prompts in terminal.\n  - `pathspec`: For gitignore compliance.\n  - `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.\n  - `keyboard`: For handling keyboard interactions (not curses-based).\n  - `curses`: Python\u2019s built-in library for creating interactive terminal programs.\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThe project appreciates the contributions from various individuals and acknowledges the use of numerous open-source libraries.\n\n#### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). \n\nThis summary aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the tool's capabilities, setup instructions, and dependencies for those interacting with the code."}
