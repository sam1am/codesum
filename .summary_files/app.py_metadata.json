{"hash": "00ae057f36fc4dc6994dd5868f30153e", "summary": "### Summary\n\nThis script facilitates the generation of code summaries and an updated `README.md` file for a project by leveraging the OpenAI API for natural language processing. It allows users to select files from a project directory interactively, generate summaries for these files, optionally compress these summaries, and ultimately create a `README.md` file based on the compressed summaries.\n\n### Functions and Classes\n\n#### `build_tree(directory, gitignore_specs, ignore_list)`\n- **Purpose**: Builds a nested dictionary representing the file structure of the specified directory, excluding ignored directories and files.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `directory` (str): The root directory to start building the tree.\n  - `gitignore_specs` (PathSpec): Specifications parsed from a `.gitignore` file for ignoring files and directories.\n  - `ignore_list` (list of str): List of directories to ignore during tree building.\n\n#### `flatten_tree(tree, prefix='')`\n- **Purpose**: Flattens a nested dictionary representing a file structure into a list of tuples.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `tree` (dict): Nested dictionary representing the file structure.\n  - `prefix` (str): Prefix for file paths during recursive processing.\n\n#### `parse_arguments()`\n- **Purpose**: Parses command-line arguments for the script.\n- **Returns**: Parsed arguments including a flag for enabling OpenAI API calls for summaries and README generation.\n\n#### `create_hidden_directory()`\n- **Purpose**: Creates a hidden directory `.summary_files` for storing summary files, if it doesn't already exist.\n\n#### `get_tree_output()`\n- **Purpose**: Generates a string representation of the directory tree.\n- **Returns**: A string containing the tree representation.\n\n#### `generate_summary(file_content)`\n- **Purpose**: Calls the OpenAI API to generate a summary for the provided file content.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `file_content` (str): The content of the file to be summarized.\n- **Returns**: Generated summary text.\n\n#### `generate_readme(compressed_summary)`\n- **Purpose**: Uses the OpenAI API to generate an updated `README.md` file based on the provided compressed summary.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `compressed_summary` (str): Compressed summary text for the project.\n- **Returns**: Generated `README.md` content.\n\n#### `create_compressed_summary(selected_files)`\n- **Purpose**: Generates a compressed summary file for the selected files.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `selected_files` (list of str): List of selected file paths.\n\n#### `parse_gitignore()`\n- **Purpose**: Parses a `.gitignore` file if it exists.\n- **Returns**: PathSpec object or `None`.\n\n#### `display_files()`\n- **Purpose**: Displays a list of files in the current directory and its subdirectories, excluding ignored ones.\n- **Returns**: List of file paths.\n\n#### `select_files(directory, previous_selection, gitignore_specs, ignore_list)`\n- **Purpose**: Uses a curses-based interactive menu for selecting files from the directory, considering previous selections.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `directory` (str): The directory to display files from.\n  - `previous_selection` (list of str): Files that were previously selected.\n  - `gitignore_specs` (PathSpec): Gitignore specifications.\n  - `ignore_list` (list of str): List of directories to ignore.\n- **Returns**: List of selected file paths.\n\n#### `create_code_summary(selected_files)`\n- **Purpose**: Creates a summary file for the selected files.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `selected_files` (list of str): List of selected file paths.\n\n#### `read_previous_selection()`\n- **Purpose**: Reads the previous file selections from `.summary_files/previous_selection.json`.\n- **Returns**: List of previously selected file paths.\n\n#### `write_previous_selection(selected_files)`\n- **Purpose**: Writes the selected file paths to `.summary_files/previous_selection.json`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `selected_files` (list of str): List of selected file paths.\n\n#### `main()`\n- **Purpose**: Main function to execute the script logic: creating directories, reading previous selections, selecting files, generating summaries, and updating the `README.md` file as required.\n\n### Notes for Other ChatBots\n- The script heavily relies on interactive command-line inputs for selecting files and confirming actions.\n- Utilizes the OpenAI API for generating summaries and `README.md` content. Ensure the environment is properly set up with a valid OpenAI API key.\n- The `pathspec` library is used to parse and handle `.gitignore` specifications.\n- It uses the `curses` library to create a text-based user interface for file selection, which might not work in non-terminal environments."}
